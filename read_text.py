# The purpose of this program is to, given a file name containing
# data collected from the instruments attached to the bubble chamber,
# create a data structure capable of storing the instruments and
# their readouts. The information for any given instrument should
# then be easily accessible and printable. Additional functionality
# for plotting any given instrument readout versus time is also
# included.
